## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your CDP credentials:
   - CDP_API_KEY_ID
   - CDP_API_KEY_SECRET
   - CDP_WALLET_SECRET

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Implementation Examples

### SDK Methods
The project showcases SDK implementations in `/pages/api/`:
- `create-wallet.ts`: Direct SDK wallet creation
- `create-smart-account.ts`: Smart account creation
- `send-user-operation.ts`: User operation handling

### REST API Methods
REST API implementations can be found in:
