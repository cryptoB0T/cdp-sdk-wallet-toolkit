USDC Rewards in CDP Wallets[](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/wallet-api-v2/docs/usdc-rewards#usdc-rewards-in-cdp-wallets "Direct link to USDC Rewards in CDP Wallets")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Eligible developers earn 4.1% rewards on their USDC simply by holding it in CDP Wallets. Currently, rewards are available to US-based individuals who maintain an average daily balance of at least 500 USDC over the course of a month in their CDP Wallets. Rewards are paid in USDC the following month to the developer's Coinbase (Retail) account.

We are working to expand USDC Rewards to additional geographies, and to businesses. If you are interested in these features, please reach out to us **#wallet-api** channel of the [CDP Discord](https://discord.com/invite/cdp).

Tip

To receive USDC Rewards, you need to have had some USDC balance in your Coinbase (Retail) account in the past.

Tax rules and reporting rules differ from country to country. Users outside of the US should consult their tax advisor for the most up to date information. U.S. customers that are subject to US tax reporting are required to report their earnings from USDC Rewards. US customers who earn more than $600 in USDC rewards will receive a 1099-MISC from Coinbase. You can learn more about the 1099-MISC on the [IRS official website](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1099-misc).
